We categorized several months worth of Tweets about COVID from Belgium by topic (government measure) and opinion. Below is a timeline of the relative number of Tweets on the curfew topic (middle) and the fraction of those Tweets that find the curfew too strict, too loose, or a suitable measure (bottom), with thenumber of daily cases in Belgium to give context on the pandemic situation (top).
